Therefore my assumption is a SQL injection attack is most likely a possibility.\n\n\nRevealing Flag0 hints the web application is running uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker image.

Even though a part of the code does have an input sanitization function in place, it doesn't sanitize for semi-colon which is commonly used for injection type attacks.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the id parameter needs to be escaped using a semi-colon to close the SQL statement and inject an update statement.\n\n \nAs you can see, the command did execute and parsed on the web page but for some reason the command is showing a try exception.

The original Nintendo Gameboy from 1991. At this point of time, this must have been sitting in a dark box for at least 20+ years. Thankfully, I have respected the sedimental value of the device by removing the batteries before long term storage to avoid battery corrosion. However, the glue that holds the display cover has dried and doesn't hold the plastic bezel anymore. \nAs I'm popping in 4x AA batteries and feeling the weight of the device has made me wonder how did I held this monstrosity for such long hours as a kid. The Gameboy powers up without issues but the LCD display is showing missing lines of pixels, more than I can originally recall when I last used it.\n\nNo biggie. We didn't have Google 30 years ago and now we do. A quick search shows that it's a connection issue so if applying heat to the LCD ribbon cable and the LCD screen, it should resolve the missing pixels. Time to crack open the time capsule.\n\n\nIn comparison to modern day EE designs, this is visually minimal and pleasing to the eyes. The amount of dust inside is not bad at all considering the time of assembly until today. Hey look, a factory worker left a fingerprint on the copper shielding.\n\nTime to strip the foam pad from the display that connects the ribbon cable and LCD screen and clean the residue.\n\n\nIf you take a look closely at the ribbon cable, you can see the vertical connections. These are the connections that will require reflow using low heat settings at around 280 celcius. Before I do that, here is a picture of what the display looks like without the reflow.\n\nApplying low heat is essential as anything higher than 300 celcius will burn the ribbon cable and will render the display useless. There are alternative solutions if this does happen which I will be showing later. For now, using my TS100 soldering iron, gently glide the hotend where the missing pixels are located. This will require patience as the heating and cooling process will take some time.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of gentle work, all the missing pixels are showing up again and the Gameboy is reassembled for old school nostalgia.\n\n\nHowever, this project isn't completed. I still remember vividly as a kid that finding a good spot with lighting was essential for playing experience. As you can see, the LCD display is not backlit like how the later Gameboy Light models were. Knowing that I will most likely keep this device forever due to sentimental reasons, I'm going to give it a second life by modifying the screen using a modern IPS display.\n\nThe IPS display kit includes the controller board, ribbon cable, glass bezel instead of the original plastic, and a plastic display jig. What I've added extra is replacing the old DC power regulator with an IPS supported version to support the extra milliamps required for the IPS display, and flash cart. More importantly, avoiding strain on the main components to keep this device alive in original condition as much as possible.\nBefore I start the modifications, I spent the extra time cleaning the shell, glue residue, and gunk build up over the past 30 years. Using a combination of isopropal alcohol 99%, dish liquid, wooden chopsticks, q-tips, tooth brush, elbow grease, and patience.\n\n\nIn case you were wondering, I did not proceed with the process called \"Retro Brightening\" as my Gameboy had been stored in a box. The shell has been protected against UV rays to prevent yellowing or discoloring of the shell. Retro Brightening is a chemical process to restore the original shell color and spray UV protection to slow down the process of discoloration. I may do this in the future if I ever decide on restoring my SNES just to experience the process.\nNow that the case and parts are dry and clean, time to install the modifications. Here is a before and after modification of the DC regulator board. I love how the new board is much simplier than the 30 year old schematic.\n\n\n\n\nTwo screw posts snipped and cutting 1 mm of plastic around the display area as the IPS display has a larger screen real estate. Using a modeling knife and an object like a PCB board as a straight cutting guide to score the shell.\n\nUsing a pair of flush cutters, snip the corners. Using a pair of flat pliers, bend back and forth the plastic that needs to be removed, it will become weak and cleanly snap off. Finally, use a filer to smooth the rough edges.\n\nApply the double side sticky tape included in the kit and do not remove the padding adhesive facing the display. Install the IPS display and connect the ribbon cables.\n\nThe hard part is completed. Desolder the speaker connected on the old board and solder to the new controller board.\n\nPlace the buttons and membranes back into the front shell and install the controller board. Make sure not to over tighten the screws as the buttons won't be responsive.\n\nCarefully connect the two halves of the shell back together while connecting the ribbon cable. Install the new glass bezel and voila! Enjoy the new bright and crispy IPS display and color changing features. My old man eyes are thanking me.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/hardware-gameboy/","title":"Retro Classic: OG Gameboy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/hardware-robotvacuum/":{"body":"Another day, another holiday season dumpster dive. My dear neighbours dumped a working Bobsweep robot vacuum cleaner made in 2016 and it didn't look too shabby.\n\nA quick test of the robot vacuum had a runtime of about 5 minutes hence why the owners most likely donated the device rather than dumping it. Rather than investing into a new battery and other replacing consumable parts, this would be a great IOT exercise of inspecting the internal components to see if it's possible to dumping the flash memory of this device and extract the dumped firmware for potential endpoints and misconfiguration.\nThere are two methods to go about dumping the firmware from hardware devices. The first option is looking for a firmware on the internet would be the easiest route, but manufacture does not offer raw bin files. Second option would have been installing the mobile application and sync the robot vacuum with a device while intercepting the network traffic using man-in-the-middle attacks. However, the potential issue is the firmware update must be available for the robot vacuum and/or finding an activity to trigger the action, these may or may not exist. I do have previous experience with those methods, so I wanted to try something new and learn more about: reading directly from on-chip flash using serial wire debugging port and fault injection to bypass read protection mechanism.\nLet's break open the device and understand the lay of the land.\n\nA breakout view of all the parts dismantled from the plastic housing. Many wires and separate modules that make up this robot vacuum: DC motors to operate the wheels and duster, dust bin sensors, speaker for alerts, infrared for wall and edge detection, and switches for bump detection.\n\nA STM32F101VBT6 ARM microcontroller is used to control and operate this device. It is common these days to see ARM microcontrollers powering internet of things devices. My initial glance was looking for accessible test access ports or vias. I took note that on the upper right corner there is an open port that resembles a 10-pin JTAG connector to interface with the board.\n\nThe charging base is interesting. I took note of it using the same wireless module on the robot vacuum. The datasheet mentions an SPI interface which would need further technical investigation on what this would entail.\nNow equipped with better clarity of the internal components and entry points, it's time to test to see if the open port is a JTAG interface. By manually probing the traces of the microcontroller pinouts using the datasheet found online.\n\nThe pinouts that are of interest is 21 (VREF), 72 (SWIO), 76 (SWCLK), and 53 (GND). These are the ports required for serial wire debugging access. As a frame of reference, the datasheet provides a reference table to determine which pinout belong to which main function.\nAfter going through trial and error of determining if the mysterious open port is a JTAG, it's worth experimenting a DIY JTAG enumerator using an Ardunio I have laying around. How it works is by assigning pins to the GPIO of the Arduino, it will enumerate the possible JTAG combinations to determine the correct pinouts to interface with the board.\n\nHowever, this process can be fincky as crosstalk between unshielded wires is a possibility. There are built-in features to determine which pair of wires are causing crosstalk, but it was not necessary for this processs as it was eventually discovered that this port was not a JTAG port, shucks. Hope is not lost yet, back to tracing the pins on the board from the microcontroller datasheet. It's hard to see where the traces lead between both sides of the board with a naked eye. The poor man's way to identify traces on a board is a high-powered light shining behind the board, mark the vias, and touch points (labelled as TP). \n\n\nAs you can see, the traces can now be traced to touch points for the pinouts of interest and solder pin headers for accessibility. The next part of the magic is using a hardware debugger tool called Black Magic Debug. What's fancy about this debugger is it implements their own GDB server if you are familiar using GDB as your debugging tool. Not only that, GDB has scripting capabilities to automate your needs. The BMD kit provides an SWD breakout board of which you connect the identified touch point pinouts.\n\nWith all the connected cables to the BMD, interfacing with the board can now be achieved.\n\nHowever, when attempting to read the on-chip memory of the microcontroller, the read protection mechanism has been enabled by the manufacture. Shucks and kudos to the hardware development team following security best practices in their production units. \n\nThat's it for now. This post will continue later when the second half of the story about trials and tribulation with fault injections is completed.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/hardware-robotvacuum/","title":"Dumpster Diving: Robot Vacuum"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/hardware-ssdrepair/":{"body":"As we all know, we should be recycling more often than not and recycling electronics is not an exception. On my usual morning walks with my dog, someone dumped a full tower sized gaming PC with some hardware damaged with reckless intent. Nothing seemed salvagable and the parts were somewhat dated in the 2016 technology era of things. However, the SSD/HDD were still up for grabs and it appears that the owner intentionally \"keyed\" the SATA ports in an attempt to destroy the data from being read. This unlucky soul did not realize that I live in the same building as them :D\n\nFor the sake of curosity, I wanted to know if this drive has been encrypted or not, due to the fact that this person keyed the drive, they may not be savvy enough to understand encryption features.\nSix dollars worth of spare parts were purchased from Aliexpress and made sure it had the right fitting as there are several different variations due to the PCB mounting holes. After waiting for a pain staking 4 weeks, the parts has arrived. On with the tutorial!\n\nTo make life easier, using a pair of flush cutters to snip away the damaged SATA port module would allow removing the pins separately rather than a whole module. Keep in mind, this isn't the way that most people would approach desoldering this component. Most experienced users would desolder the pins right away.\n\nNext, desoldering each of the pins using a clean soldering iron. This also includes the two grounding pads located on the left and right side of the SATA module.\n\nEach of the desoldered pin pads will need to be cleaned or else bad soldering joints may occur. Using a soldering braid wick will fix this up in a jiffy.\n\nTime to slot in the new SATA module and solder the left and right grounding pads first for proper data pin alignment. Use plenty of flux on the data pins for the solder to flow and adhere to the PCB pads.\n\nThe final result of the soldering joints should be shiny and not dull. A dull look usually means a cold soldering joint which is bad. If all is well, put it back together and boot it up on a separate virtual machine or an isolated machine for testing purposes. \n\nAs I'm not surprised, the drive is not encrypted. It can be mounted as NTFS and files are readable. The sensitive details that were found on this drive won't be shared for obvious reasons. My curiosity has been satiated and reached to a conclusion. Don't worry, I'll follow best practices and ethics to ensure that data is wiped and destroyed.\nThis is a lesson for everyone: sanitize the data stored in electronics and physically destroy the electronics in an unrecoverable fashion. On a related note, those smart light bulbs that people throw out regularly can still store wifi passwords in plaintext and can be extracted using a logic analyzer. I'm waiting for one to show up in the recycling bin for demonstration purposes.

Seeing how Dinesh tried to delete this information from his commit, this must be the way in.  I've edited the code to just see if we can get a token:\n\nAnd it works! A token has been generated.\n\n\n\nYou can probably skip this part but I wanted to check the token to make sure it's validated each time it's being generated. There is an endpoint named auth/check that will do the trick.\n\n\n\nSo now we got the token generated, validated, and ability to grab brew information from the API, what to do next? This is where I got stuck the longest but I learned about fixing my enumeration processes.\nI fell into two rabbit holes:\n\nTrying to exploit phpmyadmin-dir-traversal which isn't a smart move because we didn't find phpmyadmin in the first place! I didn't get stuck here long though.\nRunning dirbuster on api.craft.htb and see if there is a hidden directory we may have missed.\n\nI'm not particular strong in code review because I haven't studied the possible exploitation when using certain functions. This is good practice for me though. I found the exploit code in this file: https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/src/master/craft_api/api/brew/endpoints/brew.py\nParticularly this piece of code:\n\nA quick Google search will show sites that talks about how eval can be exploited if misused. \nEval really is dangerous\nA quick note about eval is the function evaluates the parameter given. If you evaluate an untrusted or unsanitized input, you can execute commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\nArmed with new knowledge, I fleshed out the rest of the code with remote code execution.\n\nIn addition, I need to generate the python reverse shell code.\n\n\n\nStart python web server and meterpreter session to receive my reverse shell connection.\n\n\n\nRun the script and I'm able to receive a shell on meterpreter session.\n\n\nTo my surprise, the user.txt flag is non-existent. I thought someone deleted the flag but nope, I am stuck in a containerized instance as hostname shows a string of random letters and numbers.\n\n\nI got lost for a while trying to figure out how to break out of this instance. I noticed there is a directory at /opt/app that resembles the same code as the repository. Out of chance, I noticed there is a file called models.py. This file generates the database structure for brew and one other important table, \"Users\".\n\nI had the immediate idea that I should have enumerated the possible hidden databases for possible logins.\n\n\nThe other piece of information that came together while looking into database enumeration was this file called dbtest.py. It's a simple file that connects to the database and retrieves 1 result from brew table.\n\nLet's see if we can retrieve data from the \"User\" table by modifying the code:\n\nTake note of the cursor.fetchmany. I got stuck on this as I forgot that it only retrieved one result at a time. Changing this piece of code will select all data from rows 1-10.\n\nAnd there it is. I got new username and passwords from the SQL database, lets see if we can log into other services with them.\n\n\nSSH doesn't work. SSH on port 6022 doesn't work either. su doesn't work either. Logging into Gogs using Gilfoyle's credentials worked! There appears to be a private repository.\n\nThe .ssh directory is our ticket in using SSH. Lets download the repository and unzip for the .ssh files.\n\n\nLogin using SSH using the same password as found above:\n\n\nDo not ever copy and paste SSH keys, they do not work. The MD5sum doesn't match with the original.{:.warning}\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n\nRan linenum and linuxprivchecker script and I didn't find anything out of the ordinary. Nothing in crontab. I started to poke around the home directory and there is a .vault-token file.\n\nA quick Google search shows up as some sort of vault key for HashiCorp.  I see that you can run vault commands so I tried and see what options I had.\n\nPoking around at what it does, I'm not entirely sure how it works.\n\n\nI started to dig around the repository again because the pattern so far with this machine is all clues can be found in the repository. I found this script:\n\nA quick Google search reveals that these commands create a SSH session using a one-time password token.\nSSH Secrets Engine: OTP SSH Password\n\n\nLet's first run the commands that we found in the script to enable SSH and allow OTP for root.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to create a cURL PUT request to get a token generated.\n\n\n\n\nCopy the token and ssh using root.\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-craft/","title":"Craft"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-emdeefiveforlife/":{"body":"“Can you encrypt fast enough?”\nThis was my first challenge on HTB.

With my limited experience with CTFs so far, I know that when port 53 is open for enumeration, a zone transfer command is required.\nBefore I begin running DNS commands to enumerate the service, I have to figure out what is the domain name I am targeting.

I'm not sure yet.\nThe next enumeration commands shows if the user has installed Az modules used for connecting to Azure resources and the connection history log file.\n\n\nLooks like it has been connected to Azure at some point of time.\n\nIt doesn't look too hopeful at the moment to be exploiting a real Azure environment.\n\n\n\nToken cache data is empty hence why you can't connect to Azure. At least I learned something about the process of Azure enumeration.\n\n\n\nMoving on, I was Googling for other ways to exploit Azure AD Sync and I came upon this script\nThe script didn't work because it couldn't find the LocalDB database. I figure it was some sort of enumeration of MSSQL table database but I couldn't find a good way to do it. I should find out more about this later.\n\n\nAfter googling some more, I came upon another script that was related and has the ability to enumerate all databases.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the discovered Administrator credential, using evil-winrm again, I was able to obtain the root.txt flag.\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-monteverde/","title":"Monteverde"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-netmon/":{"body":"\n\nNmap scans show FTP is open on port 21 with allowed anonymous access.

The web server is hosting a web application called PRTG which is a network monitoring software. The version 18.1.37.13946 can be found below. Looking through exploit-db, there is no vulnerable exploits to be found.\nTrying to figure out how to bypass the login, I've proceeded with brute forcing the login using hydra but no luck.\nI started to dig through what else was on the system using FTP. I would find a hidden folder for PRTG located in:\n\nInside this folder, there are old backup files and configuration files.\n\nRoaming through the configuration files, I found something that was notable. The configuration files contain passwords even if it was encrypted. I started to dig through all the configuration files that I could find and there was only 1 file that showed an unencrypted password.\n\nUsername prtgadmin and password PrTg@dmin2018. I tried logging in with these credentials and it didn't work. Not sure what to do next, so I got a hint from someone in Discord and they said try using the PrTg@dmin2019 instead. Wow, it worked and something I would have never guessed. Enumerating passwords is something I will take note of next time.\n\n\nOnce I'm logged in, I started to play around with PRTG as I never used this platform before. It was kind of confusing where everything is and how it works. After a while, I had a hunch that I had to create a sensor or something to trigger a script of some sort. I googled for possible code execution and I stumbled upon this site: https://www.codewatch.org/blog/?p=453\nIt's smooth sailing from here following his instructions and modifying parts as my own. How it works is creating an EXE notification object that triggers the Demo - Outfile.ps1. Why Outfile.ps1? Outfile.ps1 doesn't sanitize the parameter being passed to it so you can append your own code for execution.\n\n\n\nMake a EXE notification with the parameters to read and output the flag to C:\\root.txt\n\n\n\nNow you need to assign this notification object to an existing sensor. You can choose any sensor at this point and modify it's notification setting to execute your EXE notification. I chose a sensor that was failing and assigned with these settings:\n\nAll you do now is watch and wait for the root flag file to be generated at C:\\\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-netmon/","title":"Netmon"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-postman/":{"body":"\n\nnmap scans show ports 22, 80, 6379 (redis), and 10000 (webmin) are open.\n\n\nPort 80 shows a web page that doesn't show much information besides a basic page with static code.\n\n\n\nMoving onto the next port 6379. It's the default port that Redis service uses. Redis is a popular NoSQL database that operates using key and value store. To interface with Redis service, I will need to install redis-tools for the CLI tool.\n\n\nOnce redis-tools has been installed, time to interface with the redis server.\n\nChecking to see if there are any useful keys value pairs with sensitive information but none was to be found. I figured at this point it's probably some server side exploit to be found. Time to start Googling.\n\n\nI found a couple of exploits on Github that creates a Redis rouge server to run a MODULE command but I couldn't get it working. After manually debugging the code, I finally realize the server doesn't allow MODULE command to be executed. Time to move onto a simpler exploit.\n\n\nThis Redis Server Exploit script will fit the job. What this script does is it will manipulate the redis configuration value to upload a public key. It will create a private key on your local machine and append the new key to the redis configuration value using redis-cli.\nHere is the blog post that will go through in detail on how it works.\nThe only problem with this script is I need to know the the name of a user on the server. We need this information so we could set the Redis’ dir to that user’s .ssh/ directory and set the dbfilename to authorized_keys. This is what happens if you run the script when don't know what the username is:\n\nNotice how it says \"ERR changing directory: no such file or directory\". I need to find a writable location that the redis server has access. This is a trial and error process of figuring out what possible locations I could save my files.\n\nAfter Googling where redis server stores the database files (/var/lib/redis), I've managed to succeed with finding write access. We just need to modify our script with the new path.\n\n\n\nWhen you execute the modified script, you should be able to get a low privilege shell as redis user.\n\n\n\nLurking around, running my linux enumeration scripts, checking to see what this system is about. I found this id_rsa.bak file stored at /opt. Obviously seems like a private key waiting to be cracked.\n\n\n\nAfter Googling around on how to crack a private key, I will have to first convert the key to a format that John The Ripper tool will understand.\n\n\n\nTime to begin cracking the extracted key using rockyou.txt wordlist.\n\n\n\nNow that we have the password, I'll try and login using the unmodified key.\n\nAccess denied. I took a look into /etc/ssh/sshd_config and shows that the user Matt is denied access.\n\n\n\nNot too sure what to do next here, I figured maybe I should try the username and password for the Webmin control panel located on port 10000.\n\n\n\nNow that I'm logged in, the control panel functionality seems limited. No where to execute commands or create cronjobs. I figured webmin has to be exploited.\nI found this Webmin 1.90 exploit for metasploit: link\n\nThis module will get you root permissions and easily obtain the user and root flag at the same time.\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-postman/","title":"Postman"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/htb-sauna/":{"body":"\n\nnmap scans show ports 80, 135, 53, and 389 are opened.\n\n\nI started with enumerating the SMB shares and see if anything would show up.

Again, there wasn't any DNS records that can be found.\n\n\n\nNext service to be enumerated is LDAP using ldapsearch. I did find up finding a username \"Hugo Smith\". I tried guessing the password to see if I would login but no luck.\n\n\n\nNext, I would proceed with the HTTP service. I found it was hosting a banking site called Egotistical Bank. Running gobuster in the background, I started to inspect the site code and eventually I found this page that could be in use for enumerating possible usernames.\n\n\n\nI started to compile a list of possible usernames that most companies would use such as:\n\nhsmith\nhugos\nhugosmith\n\n\n\nI used a tool called kerbrute python script to help enumerate the list of users that I created to validate the possible usernames. As you can see, it validated the user hsmith. Eventually I created the other possible users listed on the website and enumerated again. The second user found was fsmith.\n\n\n\nUsing the Impacket script, GetNPUsers.py, I used fsmith username and see if the ASREPRoast attack would work on this account. This attack looks for users without required Kerberos pre-authentication. The python script tries to harvest the non-preauth AS_REP responses for brute forcing. As you can see, an AS_REP response has been acquired.\n\n\n\nUsing hashcat, I saved the AS_REP response hash to a file and proceeded to deploy brute force attack. The hash has been cracked.\n\n\n\n\nWith this new username and password, the next logical step is trying to connect using WinRM using evil-winrm. Once connected, I was able to obtain user.txt flag.\n\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\n\nI began enumerating the Windows machines using Winpeas. It immediately found AutoLogon credentials in the registry for svc_loanmgr. You can also find this registry manually using a command.

How kerberoasting attack work is attempting to harvest TGS tickets for services that run on behalf of user accounts in the AD, not computer accounts. As you can see, hsmith TGS ticket has been obtained.\n\n\n\n\nI sent the TGS ticket to hashcat for brute forcing. The hash has been cracked and had the same password as fsmith.\n\n\n\nAfter spending some time poking around using the hsmith credentials and enumerate services with it, I didn't find anything special about the account.\n\n\n\nAfter digging further, I decided to see if I can dump the Administrator password using secretsdump.py. I got lucky. I sent the hash to hashcat and I was unable to crack the hash using rockyou.txt.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, I was able to login as Administrator using evil-winrm using pass-the-hash technique.

The requirement is having another SSH accessible machine. How SSH local port forward works is:\n\n\nIt will create a localhost port 9000.\n\n\nAny data traffic sent to 9000 will be redirected to the SSH tunnel travelling to the remote machine.\n\n\nThe remote machine will then forward the request to the target destination.\n\n\n\n\nComplete command:\n\nBreakdown - Creates localhost port 9000:\n\nBreakdown - Forward data using port 80:\n\nBreakdown - Forwarded data is being sent to remote machine 10.10.10.73\n\n\n\nTo check for file type:\n\n\nThis is good for bypassing file checking.\n\nThe -p switch is great for creating a chain of non-existant folder(s)\n\n\nValentine\n\nA tool to scan if the https is vulnerable to heartbleed vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a modern exploit like heartbleed, you may think, how do I begin to find this exploit and test it on a system. First, github will be your main source of finding proof of concept code. Second, find forums such as 0x00 and see if there are brief tutorials on how to execute the PoC. Third, if there is no clear tutorials, read the simple explanation concepts and see if you can read the code to dissect how it works. From there, you can tweak the small parts of the code for the desired outcome.\n\n\nAn offline way to decode base64 strings:\n\n\n\n\nSomething I wasn't aware of is if you have a private .key file, the filename is usually the username.\n\n\n\nIf linenum.sh script output doesn't show anything obvious, always go back and think about what other simple thing you could do. In this case, you can check out the user home directories for bash history or stored files.\n\nPoison\n\n\nNmap Bootstrap XSL stylesheet - This is pretty cool to visualize nmap logs using a web browser. Great for reports.\n\n\nPHP info File Upload exploit - if phpinfo page shows File Upload is on, you can upload a file and PHP will save the file into a cached directory. PHP server assumes that as long as the file cannot be accessed publicly, there will be no code execution. If you launch an LFI attack, code execution is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPayload All The Things - A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security\n\n\nThere will be times where you download a script and when you try to execute it, errors will occur. Instead of instinctively Googling about the error, pause and think about what the error is about.\n\n\nDoes the script fail before it starts attempting to connect to the target server or does it fail during when it attacks the target server?\n\n\nIf it fails during when it attacks the target server, use a middle man tool such as Burpsuite and use the proxy setting to capture what the script is sending.\n\n\nThe proxy IP address Burpsuite should use is the target server and port. When you run the script, change the IP address to localhost and target port.\n\n\nIf the script is trying to find a specific parameter, why isn't it finding it? Typo? Encoding? Syntax? These are the things you need to pay attention when troubleshooting scripts.\n\n\n\n\nBurpsuite results shows up as &amp;gt\n\nScript is looking for '&gt;' symbol which resulted a script error.\n\n\n\nSANS SSH Konami Code - Useful for running commands on local machine without terminating a running SSH session and other shortcuts.\n\n\nListen on local ports 6801 and 6901, send any traffic through SSH to 127.0.0.1 5801 and 5901.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also contaminate the httpd-access.log using Burpsuite through User-Agent tag.\n\nDevel\n\nThe “ms##” indicates the year of the patch. For example, ms10 would be 2010. If you see a long sequential list of possible exploits, check what the OS version is and check when it was first released. This piece of information will tell you if this machine has been maintained or not.\n\n\n\nIn msfconsole, there is a module to suggest an exploit by testing the current open session.\n\n\nOptimum\n\nIf execution of an exploit doesn't provide feedback results like in Burpsuite, it's a called a blind execution. It's difficult to tell if the exploit worked or not. In these type of scenarios, try simple code execution testing such as pinging back to yourself. To know if the remote server is pinging back, you will need to use tcpdump on the listening interface to see the response back. Once you verify the response is valid, you can proceed with trying to reverse shell the machine.\n\nThis Burp request won't show results so it's hard to know if remote code execution is successful or not: \n\nBut using tcpdump on an interface will monitor the ping response to verify the remote code execution is successful. \n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/samratashok/nishang/tree/master/Shells - Great repo for Powershell reverse shell scripts.\n\n\nCommand execution to load Powershell reverse shell:\n\n\n\nEncoded in Burpsuite:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock - PowerShell script to quickly find missing software patches for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/ippsec/","title":"Ippsec Review Notes"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/pentesterslab/":{"body":"Python 01\n\nThis code snippet is an example of cryptographic flaw of using sha2 as a hashing algorithm. SHA2 is susceptible to an attacked called length extension. A length extension attack can allow an attacker to use a Hash and the length of the message and extend the message. In the example code snippet, the sign_for_payment function is using SHA2 to encode the hash and the redirect_for_payment function will use it to sign payment information as a validation control measure. The weakness in this code snippet is found in the payment_info variable of which the amount is concatenated before encoding into hex format. By appending a duplicate amount parameter with a nafarious value assigned, it would overwrite the initial float amount ($20). This is possible because with length extension attacks, an attacker knows the state of the hashed key and messaging pair up to the point of appending a duplicate amount parameter. It is then trivial to figure out the hashing algorithm used and generate a new hash digest. The new forged hash digest will be sent back to the server as a valid request because the signature being the same length as the original. Hence why there is no need to know the original key to sign the message and the forged hash digest is accepted as if the password was known. \nPython 02\n\nThis code review snippet is an example of why URLs should be ended in a /. Without the /, a malicious attacker can register a nefarious top level domain that could bypass the filter by creating a subdomain such as vulndomain.com.evildomain.com. This flaw is called a server side request forgery (SSRF) as in the line where response.read() is found, the server will read the request and return the response value. This flaw can be leveraged by fetching data from malicious endpoints and have the server parse the information.\nPython 03\n\nThe weakness in this python source code can be found in the pickle.loads method. Pickle is a python module that is used for serializing and deserializing data. Data serialization is a process to convert a state of data object into a byte stream such as the following commonly used formats: JSON, YAML, and XML. Data deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is recreated into an object stored in memory. In the code snippet, the cookie is fetched from HTTP headers and reads the cookie value from the username attribute. This can pose an issue as a cookie can be easily manipulated as a malicious source of data for the server to be read from. As displayed in the example of pickle.loads, the module deserializes the username cookie value using base64.b64decode method. Further research shows that a directive called reduce can be used to create a malicious serialized object. In theory, if a serialized object is encoded into a base64 payload into the cookie value, the HTTP server would know how to deserialize it using base64 decode function.\nPython 04\n\nThe weakness in the code snippet can be found when the cookie session_id value is read by using open method. The cookie can act as a source of malicious input and by modifying the cookie value contained in session_id, the open method can be vulnerable if validation of the input is not performed. Python's open method is designed to open a file and read the file line by line. Knowing this fact, if the cookie value input contains a directory traversal path such as ../../file.txt the open method will read the contents as such. A sample output can be seen like this:\n\nPython 05\n\nThe weakness in the code snippet can be found in the conn.execute as it's susceptible to SQL injection. The post_id can act as a malicious source of which if the post_id is not validated or sanitized, you can append other SQL query operators that would modify the statement to extract sensitive information from other fields. To mitigate against this type of attack, never use the input directly and use prepared statements. Prepared statement is also called parameterized queries which is a coding technique to define the SQL statement first then pass in the parameter to the query later. If a malicious input would be attempted, the input will be treated as a data instead of code.\nPython 06\n\nThe weakness in this python code can be found in the pattern variable. The regex pattern assigned to the variable is a string filter designed to keep out strings in the URL that contain ../../. However, I still don't know how this filtering can be bypassed as I've tried all sorts of combination which includes trying to manipulate the getcwd method.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/pentesterslab/","title":"Code Review Adventures"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-10dayspt1/":{"body":"I’ve been back for a full 2 months now since the retreat and finally decided I’m going to start a blog to share my experiences. I’ve tried starting a blog numerous times in the past but I’ve made the commitment and follow through this time. How did I come to this firm decision? Well, I had an epiphany during my 10-day retreat and helped me tremendously with day-to-day life. Some people that I spoke to said I look and behave differently. It’s almost like if I was a different person. Addictions and stressful situations that use to agitate my emotions is now subsided and controllable with practice. Now equipped with better coping tools, my overall outlook in life is much improved and I’m ready to tackle this world again with clearer enthusiasm than before. Bring it.\nDissection of Self\nFor the past 5 years or so now, things got strange. I never felt so lost on what I wanted to do and I was 25 at that time. Broke up with a long time girlfriend that I was comfortable with and working at a fun IT job but night shifts were brutal. Dazed and confused, there were many days that I had no idea time has gone and other days, it felt like time has slowed down to melting glacier speed. No sense of control over my life other than grinding away and recover during my off days. My emotional behaviour was getting more edgier than before and I noticed this on multiple occasions but I never confronted this demeanour. I once thought that as an alpha male, you should be suppressing these type of emotions and ignore what was soon to be a build up of a emotional shit storm waiting to happen. Seems like no one was agreeing with the job I was undertaking, especially family members. This pressure eventually tipped me over the edge and so I went hunting for an adventure or a break.\nEventually I took a leap of faith by joining a friend and now mentor of mine to drum up some business. You think it would be easier from here on out but I was dead wrong. One thing lead to another, screwing up tasks that I knew were easy made me lose confidence in myself on what I did best. My thoughts were ruminating on situations that went wrong that was out of my control. One day I woke up in the morning feeling like I lost everything. It’s almost like someone came to your bed side in the middle of the night and stripped away your mojo. All I had left was dysphoria and anhedonia. This feeling lasted for more than a year and I tried fixing myself by experimenting with heavy drinking to eating hash cookies. Nothing worked effectively but I was still persistent with fixing this depression state once and for all.\nFeeling shitty and belittled, December 2012 rolled around and I had to join the yearly Christmas party celebration with friends and this is where I had an epiphany. A friend of mine emotionally cracked after couple of drinks and started to tell sob stories about past away loved ones. Trying to compare sob stories with one another who joined in the conversational bout. Finding out who can feel the most sorry for themselves so other people will hopefully provide comfort they’re seeking for. This is where I thought to myself, my problems are no more important than anyone else. Trying to solve their emotional issues by seeking comfort is a band-aid solution. I knew I had solve my problems by myself because no one best knows why except for yourself. Seeking for true sense of reality from self reflection is a very difficult and awkward thing to do. This is why people pop pills to solve their issues because it’s quick and easy. Sure, there are valid reasons for medicating such as chemical imbalances in neurotransmitters but I get the sense that most people just want a quick fix. This is not the route I’m willing to abide by.\nI still remember right after that party, I didn’t go to sleep at all. I was seeking relentlessly on the internet for all sorts of ways to fix myself. I wanted a solution that can “reboot” my state somehow. My solutions were ranging from sensory depravation tanks to ayahuasca or even LSD. After weighing the risk involved and devised safety net plans with some of these practices, I remembered reading a fun article about a person’s Vipassana experience from a magazine article. It sounded intense which I can relate and I thought it was going to be easy to do. But I can assure you, I ate those words so quickly and didn’t expect the type of results I got out of it. So now you know how my journey began, this is my 10-day Vipassana experience.\nThe Arrival\nI have arrived at the retreat. I didn’t know what to expect from myself while wandering around the premises. All I had to do is trust myself that I’ll make out of the 10 days just fine. If I didn’t get any insight, that would be fine as well. I went into the course expecting to get something but I wasn’t sure what. I read online blog posts on other people’s experience but wasn’t enough to boost my confidence to succeed. I can only advise that you shouldn’t obsess with seeking what others are experiencing. Everyone’s experience is different on some level. There were many new students attending with all sorts of people age and race-wise. I wouldn’t say they were newbies on a spiritual level. I have met couple of people who has done spiritual retreats of other practices and was bewildered with the journey they experienced.\nAfter unpacking my stuff in my room, I proceeded to the cafeteria to sign a waiver form.\n\n\nDuring the course you must follow the five precepts: to abstain from killing any being (bugs and etc), stealing, telling lies (no swearing), sexual activity (no fap), and any intoxicants (no alcohol) unless it’s a type of medication you are prescribed for.\n\n\nRespect the noble silence. This means silence of the mind, body, and speech. No sign languages or gestures are allowed.\n\n\nDiscontinuing other forms of rituals (religious objects, rosaries, crystals, talismans, etc), deity worship, and meditation techniques.\n\n\nNo physical contact is allowed.\n\n\nWear plain and loose clothing. Less distraction for students.\n\n\nNo physical exercise or yoga. Basic stretching is permitted.\n\n\nNo writing, reading, or listening to music.\n\n\nNo technological devices. Simple watches or clocks are permitted. Any devices that can contact with the outside world is not permitted.\n\n\nYou must adhere with the daily meditation timetable.\n\n\nReading the code of conduct felt like I was opting into becoming a inmate of solidarity confinement. Papers has been signed and now I have to surrender my belongings like keys, wallet, and the ultimate sceptre of knowledge, my smart phone. I checked my emails one last time and my OCD habit of emptying junk mail when it purges automatically every week. I kissed it good bye and it was gone out of my hands. Feeling naked and couple of IQ points dumber, I had to walk off the separation anxiety. Staring at my left jean pocket with a permanent rectangular faded shape reminded me of my phone. It’s like I’m going through a bad break up or something. The smart phone was an extension of my nervous system, I felt phantom vibrations tingling like a missing limb. I admit it, I’m a technology-addled person who needs help.\nDuring the orientation, the course manager proceeds with explaining the code of honour, course boundaries, and daily announcements. By the end of the orientation, she tells us:\n\"Work diligently, work ardently, work intelligently, work patiently and persistently, and you are bound to be successful, bound to be successful.\"\nI heard this same sentence throughout the 10 days repeatedly. It was part of Buddhism mantra. At first, I didn’t take that statement seriously but I soon realized this retreat was no walk in the park.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-10dayspt1/","title":"Ten Days of Silence - Part 1"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-10dayspt2/":{"body":"Getting up at 4:00AM to get ready for 4:30AM group meditation hall was a personal struggle. I was still half asleep and didn’t get much rest because I was sleeping on a gimpy bed. It literally sags into a U-shape once laid on top of it for 3 minutes. I wasn’t too happy about this because if I don’t get proper rest, I’m going to be cranky. But I didn’t let myself think of it that way. Instead, I thought of it as a motivator to get out of bed, force myself to get up and walk outside of chilling 2 degree celsius weather. If I stayed in my room to meditate alone, I know I’ll be snuggling back into my warm bed sheets within the next couple of minutes.\nThe Commitment\nMy experience in the meditation hall for the first few days were really boring and frustrating. All we had to do is observe our respiration through our nose. Is the air coming from both nostrils or one sided? Is the air hot or cold? For the next 3 days, that is all we did and this is where anguish begins.\nI started to unveil all sorts of habitual things I didn’t know about myself that could be harmful or pleasant. Even though this task of observing respiration should be simple to follow, I noticed my mind will lose focus every 2–4 minutes and starts to wander off to LaLa land. Throughout my adulthood, I’ve been told to have ADHD but honestly I never believed it’s a disorder but really part of my personality. I’ve taken the MBTI test (it has flaws) a month ago and figured out I’m a ENFP which some characteristics correspond to ADHD-like behaviour.\nNoticing how terrible my mind has been conditioned, I motivated myself to do better. When I say motivated, I mean fully committed to the act of changing your life for the better. Not some cheap ego boosting trick. If I don’t get motivated and just do things half ass, the experience will be half ass as well. This is not why I’m here at the retreat. I wasn’t here to commit 10 gruelling days of my life to sit around twiddling my thumbs. I was seeking to solve why I’m here in this world for. Finding my flow.\nLessons about pain\nFor the entire 10-days, I was suffering the longest excruciating back pain that I’ve ever experienced. Regardless how painful it was, I persisted through the pain by focusing on my respiration. For some uncanny reason, the more I focus on the respiration, the less pain I would feel but only slightly. I wasn’t sure if my brain pain responses were playing tricks or was I really learning the technique correctly. But finding out this trick, I realized pain can be objectified as something physical that is not being attached to something mental.\nDuring the first 3 days of practice, I would secretly peek and observe others in the room and see if they were in pain of some form because I sure hell was. I thought I seen a good portion of students were relax and calm. At the end of the noble silence, I eagerly asked everyone if they experienced immense pain. All of the first timers and some of the old students said hell freaking yes. My room mate with numerous spiritual journey experiences said it was one of the most painful spiritual journey he’s ever encountered although the end result was on par with Ayahuasca experience in Peru. Maybe I don’t have to go to the depths of the Amazon jungle after all.\nDid I swallow the red pill?\nBeing mentally and physically taxed every night, I had very strange lucid dreams for 3 days straight. During the 2nd night, I dreamt that I was on a pirate ship with Johnny Depp in a red brownish colour clay form. All of a sudden he disintegrated in front of me and a giant octopus arm came up from the side of the ship and grabbed my leg. I freaked out and quickly swung my left leg in a sweeping motion that smacked against the wall beside me. A loud bang was made and I heard the guys next door shuffling in their bed, I think I woke them up. I was perplexed on what the heck happened and embarrassed at the same time. It was 2:30AM and I have less than 2 hours of sleep before waking up for another mind bending day.\nIt wasn’t the only lucid dream I had during my stay, I had other dreams that were just as vivid. In this other dream, I spoke out loud while I was sleeping. I think I said something along the lines of “Shut the fuck up dumb ass!” to a bank robber in my dream. My room mate chuckled at what happened and once again I was embarrassed. I wanted to apologize for disturbing his sleep but we couldn’t communicate during noble silence!\nI was a bit concerned with the dreams I was experiencing so I sought after speaking with the assistant teacher. The assistant teacher said it’s normal to experience lucid dreaming. He said “ignore what you dreamt and know that it’s not real. I am going through the phase of shedding saṅkhāra in my unconscious mind”. Saṅkhāra is a unit of misery in your mind that creates volitional conditions which make up your subconscious habits. By shedding saṅkhāra, you’re liberating yourself from cravings and aversions. For you science folks, I don’t know if this is true or not so I’ll let you decide for yourself. The lucid dreams did eventually tone down and more or less stopped by day 5.\nMada Mada Dane\nThere were couple of times when I wanted to quit like on day 4. What held me together were quotes and insights from S.N. Goenka’s discourse videos played every evening. “Don’t react, just observe.” This quote really helped me throughout the daily practices. Understanding your sensations before reacting to any situation. If you react to every type of situation, you’re teaching the subconscious to react with sensations of cravings, aversion, and disillusions. You must discipline your mind from these 3 types of reactions by first controlling your sensations. This is when I first learned the meaning of equanimity. An equanimous person does not get subdued by failure or becomes too happy when succeeding. Those two characteristics was the opposite of how I was living my day-to-day life. I wanted balance and this was what I was looking for.\nStrangeness Happened\nOn day 4 and onward, we were beginning to learn how to feel sensations on each part of the body. Starting from top of the head and down to your toes. Inch by inch, we focus on feeling the sensations. This was way harder than focusing on your nose area. There were many blank spots such as back of my neck which I didn’t feel anything besides pain. Pain is a sensation but I did not classify as such until S.N. Goenka mentioned it during the discourse videos. The reason why I didn’t classify pain as a sensation is because I was expecting blissful sensations like everyone would expect. Instead my entire body was filled with pain. If I wanted pain, I wouldn’t have come to this retreat, I had pain in my life already.\nI continued on sitting through the 2 hour session and it seemed like forever but something strange happened. About 1.5 hours into sitting, I felt a tingling vibration in my chest area. It felt like if every cell was vibrating at a high frequency. I sat there as still as I could and observe what this phenomenon was happening with my body or mind has manifested.\nOne of the things I definitely felt was my back became pain free. I started to erect my body more upright and felt lighter physically and mentally. I was profusely sweating around my upper body area but didn’t feel cold instead I was feeling warmer. This sensation felt good, I mean like really good. I knew I shouldn’t be craving for this pleasurable sensation for a long period of time so I had to break my meditative state. I looked around and no one was in the hall, everyone left except for me. I didn’t exactly know what happened to me but I felt like I was mentally rebooted. My mind feels lighter and clearer ever than before. At that moment, I broke down and cried to myself because I knew I found something I was seeking for the longest time. Breaking the shackles that plagued my mental well being.\nTriggering the Strangeness\nNear the end of every session, S.N Goenka Hindu chants are played through the speakers. You can hear people in the room breathe a sigh of relief as it’s an indication of 10–15 minutes left before meditation session end. This was only the beginning of the journey for myself. If you want to relate on what I was feeling — have you ever listened to your favourite song and had goose bumps? Well, this tingling vibration is something like that but not quite. The tingling vibration is amplified by the chants and the vibrating sensation spreads itself around my body. I’ve had this phenomenon happened consecutively on day 5, 6, and 7. I can only summon this sensation during the morning hours between 6:00AM — 6:30AM.\nMy teacher was a bit surprised when I told him about this sensation because I’m a new student. He said not to crave for these pleasurable sensations. “To achieve true enlightenment, you must not crave for enlightenment. True enlightenment is free from craving.” I don’t know if I really did experience enlightenment but my body felt lighter and my pain subsided to non-existent level.\nThin Privileges\nAfter going through trial and tribulations, I finally settled into a daily systematic routine — more or less by day 5. For days when I felt mentally and physically beat up, I always looked forward to vegetarian meals, especially breakfast. Oatmeal with cinnamon dates, yogurt, raisins, sunflower seeds, and a splash of almond milk. One slice of toast with ghee and strawberry jam. I still remember there was one day I felt very mentally exhausted and we had jap jae (Korean glass noodles) for lunch, it gave me the emotional boost I needed to get by the rest of the day.\nEvery meal was surprisingly satisfying as there are many choices for you to mix and match. I’ve never been on a strict diet before because I don’t struggle with weight issues. I know, I’m lucky. But without much protein, I know I’ll be losing weight or muscle mass and fast, it’s just how my own body works. Before I went to the retreat, I was weighing in at 65 kg (143 lbs). By the end of the 10-day retreat, my weight dropped to 62 kg (137 lbs). Going through a strict dieting protocol was an insightful experience. Not only did I lose 3 kg (6 lbs), I felt my mental clarity was sharper and more alert but this causation could also be the result of intense meditation sessions as well.\nRedefining of Self\nBy the end of the course, I can happily say I can meditate for an hour or more with little agitation. I was proud that I completed the course and learned new coping tools to tame my monkey brain. I’m ready to take on the world again. I never would have thought these 10-days were the best 10-days of my life.\nMajority of my 20s was focused on achieving something successful on societal standards so I was jumping from one idea to another. Craving for success so persistently to the point I felt like I lost like half a decade of my life mindlessly reacting and not living in or observing the present moment. Unfortunately, none of the grandiose ideas ever succeeded and all I got was misery and lost confidence on what I did best. Watching your peers climbing corporate careers made me think I should have done the same thing but I knew deep inside settling into a corporate career wasn’t the choice I’m willing to settle with. I don’t want to regret for the things I didn’t do, I’d rather regret for what I have done.\nFor a period of time, I was living in the state of dysphoria and anhedonia which eventually downward spiralled into a state of funk. It’s one of the scariest feeling one should face and only you can only figure it out. I don’t know if you will get the same results as I did but really you have nothing to lose for trying.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-10dayspt2/","title":"Ten Days of Silence - Part 2"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-artofmemory/":{"body":"\nIn this day and age, technology has become an integral part of our society. Smart phones changed our lives by how we store and consume information. We rely on these advanced technological devices to store important information such as birthdays, phone numbers, addresses, passwords, notes and other important items. Externalizing our memories with this level of reliability and easy instant access, why would anyone want to laboriously spend the time remembering simple things?\nAfter reading this book called “Moonwalking with Einstein” by Joshua Foer, I was entertained, captivated and inspired on trying out the techniques described in the book. After doing some thorough research, I began to slowly go through the training process and it was a strange journey.\nHistory of memory\nThe history of memory begins with the famous Greek orator Simonides of Ceos. According to ancient texts, Simonides was known as the person who invented the Greek alphabet and excelled at writing poetry with colorful imagery which most people admired about. Using his talents he devised a technique called the method of loci, in other words, a memory palace. This technique utilizes your imagination, creativity and visualization to enhance the vividness of what you want to remember. Sounds confusing?\nLets go through an example of how you would use the method of loci technique. Lets decide on remembering 3 things that you’ll need to pick up from the grocery store. Milk, eggs, and ice cream.\n\n\nPick a location that you frequently visit and know it’s surroundings such as your home, office, or coffee shop. Imagine and visualize yourself being there. The spot you have in your mind will be the starting point. Keep that in mind.\n\n\nPick 3 rememberable spots in the area but make sure you can imagine yourself walking through it in sequence. For example, imagine your mom wearing a yellow big bird t-shirt doing jumping jacks and drinking milk at the front main entrance.\n\n\nNow walk through the front entrance, what is the next rememberable spot? For example, it’s a stairwell in my house and I see my dad wearing a ripped tank top performing push ups on top of carton of eggs.\n\n\nMoving on to the next memorable spot. It will be my living room. I imagine my oldest sister dancing on top of the coffee table while eating ice cream with an ice cream scoop.\n\n\nNow take a deep breathe and imagine yourself being at the starting point in step 1. Can you see the images vividly as though it’s alive? If you tried, you should be seeing something or at least feel like you had a better recall capability.\n\n\nWhat all memory techniques have in common is underlining idea that is called elaborative encoding. Elaborative encoding enhances retrieval by associating a person (mom), action (jumping jacks) and object (milk).\nScientific evidence\nWhy does this mnemonic technique work? I couldn’t find any concrete studies on what exactly our brains are doing biologically and why. I can only suspect our brains like to remember things that are out of the ordinary in a spatial environment which creates a story in your mind. It’s like how you can recall a favourite movie scene because it captivated your attention and felt like you were there with the actors. Lastly, humans are built for pattern recognition so seeing things in an orderly manner in chunks and trying to link relationships using imagery between them could further enhance our recall.\nRepetitive Retrieval Practice\nAlthough, there are scientific studies that show repetitive retrieval practice has a greater effect on retrieving memories than elaborative encoding. As I found out during my extensive memory training, elaborative encoding is a process to make it easier to remember things but deciding on whether you want to keep it as long or short term requires a whole another set of processes.\nFirst, lets take a look at the forgetting curve.\n\nAs you can see, the forgetting curve is steep at first but becomes less as days go by with practice. To optimize this process, you’ll need to incorporate a learning technique called spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is a technique that incorporates a flash card system with increase or decrease intervals of time between right or wrong answer. This technique will find out knowledge gaps of information isn’t sticking to memory which then keeps repeating until you finally memorize it. It’s quite fun to use during long commutes and I wish I had known about this when I was in school.\nReal life improvements\nNow armed with all this newfound knowledge, how did it improve my life? Well, it took some time and dedication to extensively see if these techniques work for myself and I’m surprised to say it did and even more.\nI set a goal for myself to compete in the 2014 Canadian Memory Championships so I spent the next 11 months training to do so. To keep my motivation and spirits high, I joined the local memory club to improve my technique and help other newcomers as well. My enthusiasm took to new heights as the memory club coordinator offered to perform public speaking engagements for other local communities in the city. I never thought I would accept such a gig but I’m glad I accepted. It gave me new personal confidence in public speaking to an audience in the hundred about my tales and screw ups. I never felt so vulnerable but I was glad that people got a kick out of my curious adventure about my memory training endeavour.\nThe first couple of months training sessions was fun and challenging. It was a personal test of patience, focus, and fortitude. Trying to imagine the object in your minds eye vividly is quite the challenge. It’s like working out a muscle that you haven’t activated in a very long time. Flexing your brain in such ways that either makes you frustrated or tears of joy.\nWhen I first started to train for remembering a deck of cards, my finishing times was hovering around 15 minutes. By the end of the first week, it was down to 10 minutes. By end of the month, I was hovering at the 5 minute mark. Clearly I can see the benefit of using this technique.\nAs months passed by training obsessively, it became such a routine that it became a grind. Another hurdle that I couldn’t quite overcome as I had other life obligations came along. By the time I reached about 8 months, I reached my best personal time of 1:20 with perfect recall. It’s not anywhere near the world record of 22 seconds but I’m fine with this result. I figured out what 20% of mnemonic techniques created 80% of the results.\nChampionship Day\nOn the day of the Canadian Memory Championships, I’m amazed that I came this far along because I have never thought I would stick around for this long and dive deep into the world of competitive memory. There were two competitions that all participants required to participate, speed cards and random words. Both of which I trained for but my primary focus was speed cards, I wanted to break my personal record where it mattered. Well, let me be honest about this. I was pretty sure that couldn’t have made 1st or 2nd place because there were serious USA memory competitors that joined. More specifically, the 3rd place winner of 2014 USA memory championships. Very cool and got to chat with him about his techniques and bigger goals afterward.\nBefore the competition started, I did all the training routines that suppose to boost memory. Get enough good sleep, meditated in the morning, light cardio at the gym, and finally a double espresso. Yes, I’m quite diligent and meticulous. But if it’s one thing I didn’t account for was training in an environment that I wasn’t comfortable in. I always trained in my bedroom. This took me off course as I didn’t manage to recall the deck of cards, twice! Disappointing but at least I managed to get enough points for this competition. Next up, random words competition. I didn’t train very much but to say the least, I beat my personal record of 75 words in 2 minutes. Not too shabby.\nWhile the judges were tallying up the points, I thought to myself that there is no way to even capture 3rd place because of my double screw up with speed cards. When they announced the winners, I was surprised that I came in 3rd place in Canadian Memory Championship! I was quite humbled from the whole experience and the people I met throughout the journey.\nThere were a lot of surprises and breakthroughs from this experiment but if it’s one great lesson I learned is finishing what you started. All too often, I would start something and not finishing because of distractions and not being laser focused. Being mindful and kind to yourself is a very important step of finishing anything. You are the own worst critic and you can’t keep beating up yourself for little things. Mistakes do happen and we learn from them. It’s okay to feel vulnerable, I’m only human and not a robot.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-artofmemory/","title":"The Art of Memory"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-museheadband/":{"body":"\nMuch of wearable technologies these days are focused around passive data tracking such as calorie intake, activity monitoring, and sleep tracking. My interest is more focused on wearable technologies that help you actively train your stimulus response.\nBiofeedback is a term defining the moment when you are consciously aware of your own biological rhythms. A simple example is a heart rate monitor, you can raise or lower your heart rate by thinking about it. I figured a good use case scenario is incorporating biofeedback in my meditation practices. Quantitatively measuring how I feel during my sit down session.\nThe Muse headband will measure your brain signals and determines if your mind is calm, neutral or active state. In each of those 3 states, it changes the environmental sounds. As an example, in the calm state of mind, you’ll hear birds chirping in the background and waves are soothing to the ear. An active state is when the birds will fly away, waves crashing to shore, and high turbulence winds.\nAt the time, I was reviewing consumer products available in the market for neuro biofeedback technologies.\nThe product that gave most hope of succeeding in this market was Interaxon’s Muse headband because of these 3 reasons:\n\n\nMuse utilizes 7 sensors (2 are used for noise cancellation). Other devices in the market only uses 1 sensor and not as accurate. The 5 frontal sensors senses brain activity signals using EEG (electroencephalogram).\n\n\nAndroid and iOS support. The app UX looked good at the time in comparison with other products.\n\n\nSDK support. I rationalized the idea in my mind that if the product didn’t meet my expectations, I could at least interface with the device to control other stuff.\n\n\nIt was released on Indiegogo in my own hometown (proved to be very helpful) and looks promising in comparison to existing consumer devices at that time. Despite the fact that I never used a crowd funding platform, Interaxon seemed trustworthy so I took the plunge and signed up for the last spots of earliest bird tier (198/200).\nAfter couple of set backs and long delays, I finally received the product after 2 years of waiting. I won’t say much about what has happened but let’s just say I’m happy that I got the device in my hands.\nAfter 1 year, is it worth it?\nOut of the box, for the most part, it feels like a polished product and not a beta device. The acrylic case for packaging seems overkill but looks high quality. As a perk of being an early backer, I was given a hard travelling case that’s useful for storage and on my travels.\nThe headband fits well on my head and I couldn’t find anyone that has fitting issues.\nWearing the headband for the full 60 minute session doesn’t feel fatiguing as it’s light enough to not notice during deep meditation. Although, the sensor band does leave a temporary pressure mark on your forehead. If you plan to meditate during midday at the office, plan ahead because it can be embarrassing.\nThe battery life could be better but for the size and weight of the device, I don’t blame them for the short battery life. On a fully charged brand new device, I could perform three 60 minute sessions before charging again. As a daily user, after about 8 months, I started to notice the battery life can barely hold a single 60 minute session. I sent an email to support before my warranty was expired and they replaced the device without a problem.\nIf you own either Android or iOS devices, you would want to use the iOS version. It’s newer, feels polished, and has extended features than the Android version. As of today, the Android version is still running the first version of Calm which is good enough for beginners. The main differences I needed most was the longer session length (&gt; 20 min), choice of background environment sounds, and meditation type option.\nThe accuracy of the sensor detecting calm and focused mind does work to a certain degree. If you’re a beginner trying to learn meditation, this headband will help you achieve the first step of awareness. For intermediate and advanced users, I would say this device won’t be much help because once you achieve deeper meditation stages, the biofeedback registers as an active mind. It doesn’t have the ability to detect or even determine what type of meditation practice you’re trying to achieve. Interaxon is aware of this problem and hopefully in the future they will have discovered new algorithms for power users.\nThe part that I felt was underwhelming was the SDK support. Although, they have come a long way since version 1. When I first tried the SDK, I had issues with connecting my headband to my Macbook Air because of bluetooth chipset support issues. When it does connect, the headband will drop signal and lose connection. Interaxon did try to help my situation by swapping my headband device to see if it will fix the issue but didn’t help. I was one of those users who had to buy a bunch of different USB bluetooth adapters and see which chipset worked the best, Broadcom surprisingly.\nOverall, I still feel Muse is a product worth getting if you want to start meditating as part of your daily habit. The people at Interaxon has built a product that is well designed for both hardware and software. The easy to follow instructions, performance tracking, and gamification features encourages users to keep practicing. They’ve meticulously focused their efforts on giving the best sensor technology and user experience as they believe meditation is beneficial for humanity.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-museheadband/","title":"Muse Headband: 1 Year Review"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-oscpcheatsheet/":{"body":"Here is my OSCP cheatsheet that I've made for myself throughout the nightly lab sessions.

There are not many certificates that requires passing a 24-hour hands-on exam. I've spent around 300+ hours in the past 3 months preparing for this exam and managed to pass on my first attempt with 80/100 points. Was it easy? Absolutely not. Don't be scared though, I'm sharing my ways to optimize your time and experience when taking OSCP.\nSkills and resources\nCoding experience is not really required but will help with reading exploits easier. I would recommend doing a quick python tutorial on codeacademy and get familiar with syntax and loops. Knowing a little bit of bash would help as well but not required.\nIf you don't have a strong IT background, read Georgia Weidman's book on penetration testing. It's a classic on what will entail when working through the OSCP labs and exam. Another recommendation is go through INE's OSCP course, it will give you an insight on what the OSCP course material is like and can be a good complementary material for the actual course.\nBuilding confidence\nTry doing some of vulnerable machines listed on vulnhub. I would advise doing some of the easier machines like Kioptrix and Mr Robot. Try attempting these machines with best of your abilities. If you get stuck, make a guess of where the vulnerability possibly be found and read some of the walkthrough guides as hints until eventually you reach root access. I know a lot of people who would speed through these walkthroughs or use them as crutches, don't do this. The point of reading walkthrough guides is seeing if you are on the right direction after spending countless of hours on a single problem. You need to train your brain to think like a hacker, a lot of hard work, discipline and time is required to think like one. Don't sell yourself short.\nLastly, know that it's not so much about the techniques you need to learn, it's all about learning the methodology that offsec is trying to teach. Coming from an system administration background did help a bit during my OSCP studies but honestly, it's all about paying attention to what you are reading and \"trying harder\" to find relevant information to help you steer in the right direction.\n\"I don't have time to study\"\nStudying for the OSCP is not something you do with minimal effort. Depending on how much experience you have in IT, you probably will have to spend 2-3 hours every night and 4-6 on the weekends for 1-3 months depending on the lab time you bought. The number of hours you spend on studying and preparing for the OSCP will reveal itself during the exam. Don't try to cram or speed through the labs. I've seen people finish all of the lab machines and still fail the exam.\nIn addition, once the OSCP lab time expires, you may want to continue sharpening your skills using penetration platforms such as vulnhub or hackthebox. If you do spend time on hackthebox, I would recommend watching ippsec on youtube to see how an experienced penetration tester approaches with problem solving. Take time to write down notes as his methodology will give you insights about your own flawed methodology.\nMaximizing lab time\nThe labs are there for you to explore and soak in the hard work of your successes and failures. From what I've seen so far, the average person that passes the exam has rooted about 30 lab machines. I found this to be true as well for myself as I only had purchased 60 days lab time. There are outliers who only rooted 10 machines and still manage to pass on the first attempt. What I'm trying to tell you is, how many machines you rooted will not matter. It's about what you have learned during the labs and how your thought processes have changed the way you think when approaching problems. As simple as that sounds, it won't be easy and will require plenty of hard work, dedication and frustration.\nPractice taking notes while working on the labs. Your notes will be clunky at first because either you copy and paste things that aren't useful, or not taking down notes at all when it's needed. Taking notes will give you a structure of how you think, what you have done so far, and if you get stuck, you can review your notes and see what the overall machine looks like and may give you an idea on approaching the problem differently.\nIf you get stuck on a machine after working on it for a hours, it can be helpful to take a peek for hints on the offsec forums. Just so you know, the hints given are cryptic and sometimes confusing which makes the situation more confusing. If you don't know what the hint is about, write it down on your notes and work on the problem later. Sometimes your brain just needs a break and focus on something else.\nDon't become too reliant on hints and before you take a peek, have a guess of what you think the vulnerability could be and if there is anything you can do to confirm your hypothesis. For instance, you got a PoC that does RCE, can you perform a simple experiment that confirms the RCE such as a ping back? How would you confirm if you have received ICMP packets? Breaking down the steps into managable pieces is immensely helpful because you will run into plenty of troubleshooting of PoC code that you don't have full understanding of.\nCreating your own checklist shows your current understanding of what your methodology and knowledge looks like. I would advise updating this checklist as you move along in the labs. By the end the labs, you will see that your checklist is like a mindmap of what you did and learned. This checklist will be helpful during the exam to keep you sane in the enumeration process.\nCreate your own cheatsheet so you can quickly refer frequently used commands such as nmap. A quick Google search will show many OSCP cheatsheets available but you should make your own because it will retain in your memory better. I personally used Dokuwiki to store my cheatsheet and works wonderfully. The great part about Dokuwiki is it saves pages as plain text. I can easily export the document and convert to markdown if needed. If you use a text editor like vim, you can easily edit the pages all in command line if that's your thing. Lastly, you don't need to run a web server to host dokuwiki, you can run the docker image on your local machine.\nFinally, don't use kernel exploits to root machines. There is only 1 machine on the labs that are designed to be kernel exploited. As I've said before, rooting all lab machines isn't the objective. Taking the time to learn the pentesting methodology and understanding your own flaws is the biggest take away from the labs. Discovering your flaws will save time from falling into rabbit holes. You will get better at not falling into rabbit holes over time as you will see the repeating pattern for failures.\nExam tips\nManage your time is #1 priority. It's a 24-hour exam but in reality, it's only 16-17 workable hours due to sleep/naps. No sleep = death. There are 5 machines in the exam. 2x 25pts, 2x 20pts, 1x 10pts. The BoF (25pts) should take about 2 hours and the 10 pointer should take another hour. Roughly, you have about 13-14 hours to work on the other 3 machines so that's about 4 hours per machine. Keep track of how much time you are spending per machine. If you get stuck for awhile, move on to the next machine and come back to it later.\nIf you have a computer with beefy specs, use it. If you don't, consider stopping or removing unnecessary running background services. During the exam, you are required by offsec's proctor to run screen sharing and web cam software, it can be quite a memory hog and CPU intensive. My 2015 Macbook Pro with 8GB specs running Kali VM was barely chugging along. My fan and CPU was running at 80-90% utilization for the entire exam. I had a bit of lag in between mouse clicks and typing. Not the greatest experience but it can be way better if you had a performance machine to work with. Lastly, I've seen people use screen recording software during the exam, I heard it's allowed but not officially. It would be useful to record your screen to capture screenshots that you may have missed.\nUse a tool to automate your enumeration process. I used AutoRecon and it was great for the labs and helpful in the exam as it will run scans in the background while you are working on a machine.\nExercise, snacks, water, and bathroom breaks. Do I need to say more about this? Take care of yourself. A 30-minute run or exercise before the exam would be helpful for the brain.\nYou managed to get enough points and passed? Great! Have a short celebration as it's only half the battle, get ready to be even more scared. I hope you taken enough screenshots required to write your report or it's a big fat zero. Did you follow your methodology and checklist? Yes? Well you don't need to be scared, you learned the ways of being a penetration tester. Congrats! Writing the report can be scary because there are many little details required for the report. I've read stories about how someone failed their exam because they submitted the report with an incorrect filename and/or format even when he/she scored 100%. Don't let this happen to you, read the report requirements in detail and many times as you need.\nEnjoy your exam. I know that sounds ridiculous because exams are suppose to be stressful right? The way I see it is, if you spent a good chunk of time studying OSCP, your knowledge and skills should have improved immensely since you've started. Passing and failing the exam doesn't matter, as long as you care about improving yourself everyday. Even if you failed, you are still better than yesterday. There will always be another chance of taking the exam, but the time loss from not improving yourself is lost forever.\nLife after OSCP\nI didn't stop at OSCP, neither should you. OSCP is considered to be a beginners pentesting certification believe it or not. It's only a part of what infosec is really about. Attacking a network is one piece of the puzzle, defending is another. I'm currently learning about the defensive side as the job market has a need for penetration testers that specializes for both sides. \nWhile OSCP is great to have, what it lacks is real world and up to date lab machines. Although, I would think offsec would disagree with my statement because they wanted to teach the fundamentals and methodology rather than focusing on the technology piece. In the real world, you need to learn about protecting Active Directory and cloud services. This is what I'm currently focusing on and it's not easy.\nFinding work in infosec is difficult if you don't have much experience in infosec even though you have plenty of IT experience. I'm trying to break into infosec and I haven't had much luck. It's not easy in this slow job market even if you have OSCP. Although, my job search is getting better lately after I creating this website to display my work and experiences.\nBest of luck with OSCP and keep on learning!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-oscpexperience/","title":"OSCP Experience"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-ttvipassana/":{"body":"I’m going to share some practical tips that I thought would be useful for any newbie student. Hopefully some of these tips will help you succeed in completing your course.\n\n\nGet to know your schedule and plan ahead. If you haven’t seen it, this is what the schedule looks like:\n\n\n4:00am — Wake up bell\n\n\n4:30–6:30am — Meditate in the hall or in your room\n\n\n6:30–8:00am — Breakfast and rest\n\n\n8:00–9:00am — Group meditation in the hall\n\n\n9:00–11:00am — Meditate in the hall or in your room\n\n\n11:00am–1:00pm — Lunch and rest\n\n\n1:00–2:30pm — Meditate in the hall or in your room\n\n\n2:30–3:30pm — Group meditation in the hall\n\n\n3:30–5:00pm — Meditate in the hall or in your room\n\n\n5:00–6:00pm — Tea break\n\n\n6:00–7:00pm — Group meditation in the hall\n\n\n7:00–8:15pm — Evening discourse\n\n\n8:15–9:00pm — Final group meditation\n\n\n\n\nArrive at the retreat as early as you can. If you want first choice on which bed you want to sleep in, this is a perfect opportunity. Make sure you test out the bed. Don’t make the same mistake as I did. I chose a gimpy bed that was U-shaped after 5 minutes of laying down on it. Luckily, I used my extra blanket to fill in the void and made it a little more tolerable to sleep in. Consider the other factors as well such as being closer to the window, thermostat control, and coat hooks accessibility.\n\n\nLayout the ground rules with your room mate. Some people like to sleep in the cold, while others prefer warmer conditions. Hope that you have a cool and easy going room mate as I did, but I still offered them to enter my space to control the thermostat and window control. It’s harder to conduct communication when noble silence is in effect, so be courteous with your bunk buddy.\n\n\nFind out if there are health conditions with your room mate. It helps that you know just incase if anything happens and you can call for help when needed.\n\n\nFill out the time slot for private bathrooms if you want privacy after unpacking your belongings. Some people have daily routines they would like to continue following and taking a shower is one of them. Personally, I found that taking a shower after lunch is the best because I’ve already stuffed myself during breakfast so lunch is usually a smaller meal. Earning you little extra time in the shower if you need it. Yes, I’m one of those guys who loves to take long showers, leave me alone.\n\n\nBring a flash light. These retreats tend to be located in some remote forest area so there might be random animals roaming around. The resort I stayed at had a pathway through a forest leading to the meditation hall. There was one early morning, I was still half asleep and walking through this dark forest. A large animal ran across the pathway and I stood there for a couple of seconds thinking if I was still dreaming or was it really a wolf or a coyote of some sort. But I didn’t care at that time, I was tired and agitated but luckily I didn’t get bitten. Chances are it might’ve been a coyote because it was a full moon and I heard howling all night long.\n\n\nWear comfortable shoes that you can slip in and out quickly. Forget bringing Blundstone boots or Vibram Five Fingers like I did. Bring a pair of beat up runners that you don’t care much about if you get mud on it.\n\n\nDo not eat like there is no tomorrow. Sure the vegetarian meals are free but this isn’t your local AYCE (All You Can Eat). But I won’t lie though, I did make this mistake myself. During the first 3–4 days, every single one of my meals were multiple plates because I was trying to compensate for low protein intake so I would load up on a lot of nuts, seeds, oats, and yogurt. Not to sound like a health conscious maniac, I was only geeking out on nutrition because my mind wanted to fixate on something fun. You may probably think, how is that fun? Well let’s put it this way. Eating should be a communal activity right? You share tables with others but all the chairs are facing towards a wall. No one sits face to face while eating. So what do you do then? Well, I did what everyone else were doing. Stare outside of the window only if your early enough to get a window seat. I preferred focusing on my food instead. Every bite I took was like this sensual experience of gratitude. Knowing how lucky you are to have a opportunity to discover what the human mind is capable of.\n\n\nBe cognizant with how much your mind sways from the meal you just ate. This trick was something I figured out on morning of day 4 when I really wanted to quit. Luckily, I had a chance to speak with the teacher about being frustrated with my focus issues. He asked to wait until the session ends and we talked privately for 5 minutes. At that moment, for some odd reason the idea of having huge meals was a causation of my mental alertness hence the last tip I just wrote. I still remember speaking to the teacher about this and he said “That could likely be the reason but hang in there and don’t quit. When your mind sways, focus on your sensations. Don’t react, just observe.” So pay attention to what you’re eating, it can make or break you.\n\n\nCoffee will be available. Yes, you coffee addicts, it will be available but don’t expect any top grade stuff you drink from your indie coffee shop. The quality of coffee offered is from the super market shelf. If this is unacceptable for you connoisseurs, bring your own coffee instead and brew it inside your mug. Green tea is also available if you need an alternative kick for caffeine.\n\n\nFind your best personal time slot to seriously meditate. Look, you committed 10-days of your life to sit down and really self reflect. Don’t squander your precious time by half ass’ing your sessions. Personally, I knew meditating first thing in the morning was easiest to start but tough to finish. My mind takes a bit of time to become fully awaken so the first hour of meditation is sometimes a breeze. Most of the time, I would sit through the 2 hour early morning session without any breaks in between and little bit of shuffling. Yes, this may seem daunting but I’ve seen experienced students do this every morning without issues. Personally, my 2 hour meditation sessions were the most profound sensations that I’ve experienced. Nothing like I’ve ever felt before in my life.\n\n\nIt’s normal to encounter lucid dreaming and nightmares. It happened to me and reported the same from others as well. I spoke to the teacher about this and said I was in the process of shedding “saṅkhāra” from my subconscious. According to the practice, a saṅkhāra is a unit of misery. Some saṅkhāra’s are deeply ingrained into your subconscious as we lead our habitual lives and other are just surface level. As you create cravings or aversion, you generate saṅkhāra. I don’t know if this directly correlates with having lucid dreams or nightmares but I’m just passing on what it means. Take what you will out of it for you science folks.\n\n\nBring a lacrosse or tennis ball. If physical pain is becoming unsurmountable, use the ball as a roller for your back. If you don’t have a ball, go to the washroom that has more space and do some basic yoga stretches. I know this is against the rules but do whatever you can to endure through the practice. I got called out by one of the course managers because I was performing a lat stretch publicly. If you’re knowledgable in stretching exercises, only perform the very basic movements because everything else is considered a yoga stretch or strenuous exercises. Yes, I’m absolutely serious.\n\n\nFind your optimal sitting posture. Be prepared for burning back pain, a lot of it. To manage your back pain, try and flex your abdomen. By flexing, you’re bracing your spinal position, giving it support for a better sitting position. Once you start to disciplining your mind, the pain will subside and almost temporarily become non-existent. There are very few students I’ve seen that can meditate in a cross legged position. The majority tends to prefer using the bench instead and put a cushion on top of it. You can bring your own sitting apparatus but they usually provide cushions, benches, and mats so you don’t need to bring it. As a reminder, if you want a chair, you have to make a request in advance and also need an explanation of why you need one.\n\n\nPractice and perform squat exercises. Prior before going to your course, strengthen up your posterior chain so your back pain can be more manageable. Check out the book called Supple Like A Leopard as it breaks down step by step on how to squat correctly.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/personal-ttvipassana/","title":"Tips and Tricks for Vipassana Course"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/tutorial-git/":{"body":"https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training\n0: Introduction\n1: What is Git\n2: Installing Git\n\n3: Getting Started\n\n\nMost often accessed\n\n\n\nAdd every change that's been made\n\n\n\nAdd commit message after adding the changes\n\n\n\nTips when writing commit messages:\n\n\nAdd shorthand codes such as \"Bugfix:\" or \"[css,js]\" or \"#8128 - \"\n\n\nBe clear and descriptive\n\n\n\n\nShow log of previous commits\n\n\n\nShow log number 1\n\n\n\nShow commit log since specific date\n\n\n\n\nSearch commit messages by name\n\n\n\nSearch commit messages by search term\n\n\n\n4: Concepts and Architecture\n\n\nTwo-tree (old) vs three-tree structure (git)\n\n\nTwo-tree: Working - Repository\n\n\nThree-tree: Working - Staging Index - Repository\n\n\n\n\nWhen you git add ., it will add all files from the Working to Staging Index. When you git commit, it will push changes to the Repository.\n\n\nWhen you git commit, it will generate a checksum(SHA-1) for each changed set. Data integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command shows where the HEAD pointer is currently positioned.\n\n\n\nThis command shows the SHA1 where the HEAD pointer is currently positioned.\n\n\n\n5: Making changes to files\n\n\nShow the current git status of the repository. It will show the current branch, what files has been added, and what files hasn't been committed yet.\n\n\n\nShow the difference between files in Working vs HEAD\n\n\n\nShow the difference between files in Staging Index vs Repository\n\n\n\ngit will remove the file from the directory and from it's Staging Index. If you manually remove a file via Finder, you will still have to remove the file from the git repository. The advantage of having it in your git repository is that you can still copy the file back from repository to Working Index.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway lesson is letting git to handle the moving/renaming/deletion of files instead of your OS commands.\n\n\n6: Git and real projects\n\n\nThis will show diff in a side-by-side instead of two separate lines f - forward b - backward + S - This will fold the lines\n\n\n\nThis is an easy way to add everything in a directory\n\n\n\nThe takeaway lesson is pay attention to the git status and make sure before committing, the files added is related to the message. I know I have ran into issues before where I lumped all my files into one big commit and it's all unrelated changes to each other.\n\n\n7: Undoing Changes\n\n\nThis command restores the file from repository to working tree. As part of best practices, -- indicates current branch\n\n\n\nUnstaging files. This is a way to unstage a file after accidently running git add . command. You don't want to lump unnecessary files into a commit that isn't related.\n\n\n\nAmending commits. This command is a way to make changes to the last commit (HEAD position). You will have to execute git add first before amending.\n\n\n\nRetrieving old versions. This command will checkout a specific file based on the SHA1 revision in git log. When executed, it will store the file in Staging Index so you can run git diff --staged to see the changes between Staging Index vs HEAD.\n\n\n\nScary command. This repositions where the HEAD position should start recording. Cassette tape analogy. Be careful when running these commands as git log won't show commits depending on HEAD position.\n\n\n--soft - Safest option. Reposition HEAD. Does not change Staging Index or Working directory\n--mixed - Default option. Changes Staging Index to match Repository\n--hard - Scariest option. Use this option when everything seems to be completely wrong. Changes Working and Staging Index to match Repository\n\n\n\nRemoving untracked files. This command will remove untracked files as a dry-run.\n\n\n\nThis command will delete the untracked file even in Working and Staging Index\n\n\n\n8: Ignoring files\n\n\nSupports basic RegEx. If you add *.php and !index.php, it means that all .php files will be ignored except for index.php\n\n\n\nWhat to ignore: compiled source code, packages and compressed files, logs and databases, OS generated files (.DS_Store), user-uploaded assets (images, videos, PDF)\n\n\nThis command affects all .gitignore files globally, not repository specific.\n\n\n\nIgnore tracked files. This command untracks and removes the file from the Working Index. It does not remove from Working or Repository.\n\n\n\nTo track empty directories, create a .gitkeep file inside the empty directory. Git will not track empty directories by default.\n\n\n9: Navigating Commit Tree\n\ntree-ish - Means something that references part of the tree. Tree-ish is a reference to a commit (SHA1)\n\nparent commit - HEAD^, acf87503^, master^, HEAD~1, HEAD~\ngrandparent commit - HEAD^^, acf87503^^, master^^, HEAD~2\ngreat-grandparent commit - HEAD^^^, acf87503^^^, master^^^, HEAD~3\n\n\n\nMost commonly used\n\n\n\nShow the last 3 commits\n\n\n\nShow commit log 3 days ago git log --since=\"2.days\"\n\n\n\nShow all commit logs between two SHA hashes\n\n\n\nShow all logs from SHA1 going forward (..) that affects index.html and show changes (-p)\n\n\n\nShow all stats and summary of commit log. A good high level view of what is most frequently changed.\n\n\n\nShow log as a graph. Great way to visualize branches.\n\n\n\nNice combo\n\n\n\nShow changes in a commit log\n\n\n\nShow changes at HEAD position\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare two commits and ignore whitespace changes\n\n\n10: Branching\n\nDiagram of how git branching looks like and where the HEAD position moves when branched: Git Branching\n\n\n\n\nFind which branch you are currently working on\n\n\n\nSwitch to specific branch\n\n\n\nCreate and switch to new branch\n\n\n\nOne thing to note, if you make a change to a file without committing and you try to switch a branch, git may throw an error saying by switching branches. It will indicate that by checking out a different branch, the file you made a change in Working will be discarded. The reason behind this is because switching branches mirrors what is in the Repository into your Working. Three ways to resolve this issue:\n\n\nSwitch to branch and discard changes\n\n\nCommit changes to current branch\n\n\nStash the changes\n\n\n\n\nShow changes between two branches\n\n\n\nShow current branch and the branch ancestors of what the current branch also contains.\n\n\n\nRename branch name\n\n\n\nDelete branch\n\n\n\nDelete branch forcefully\n\n\n\n11: Merging Branches\n\n\nMerge specific branch into current branch\n\n\n\nWhen merging, the current branch is the receiving branch.\nFast-forward merge vs true merge. FF merge is when the master branch hasn't diverged into a branch that has been making changes ahead of master branch. True merge (no-ff) is when it creates a new commit on current branch with merging branch as a new starting point. It does not remove the merging branch.\n\n\n\nGit merge conflicts. Git will indicate that there is a merging conflict and advises to resolve conflicts before committing. git status will show you which file is causing the issue and if you edit the file, it will have sections where the conflicts begin and end.\n\n\nResolving git conflicts:\n\n\nAbort merge\n\n\nResolve the conflict manually\n\n\nUse a merge tool (learn to do this manually first)\n\n\n\n\nAbort the merge\n\n\n\nUse this command to show changes when resolving merging conflict issues\n\n\n\nGreat way to take a look at the branches in terminal. Use this when resolving conflicts.\n\n\n\nShow various tools you can use to troubleshoot conflict issues.\n\n\n\nStrategies to reduce conflicts:\n\n\nKeep lines short. It will be easier for git to indicate where the conflict between two files are rather than a chunk of paragraph\n\n\nKeep commits small and focused.\n\n\nBeware stray edits to whitespaces (spaces, tabs, line returns)\n\n\nMerge often. May not be practical but the longer you wait, the chances of running into conflicts become greater\n\n\nTrack changes to master\n\n\n\n\n\n12: Stashing Changes\n\n\nStash file from Working\n\n\n\nShow stashed files\n\n\n\nShow diff of stashed file\n\n\n\nRemember, stashing doesn't care what branch you are currently on or which branch you stashed it from. Stash when executed copies the file(s) to the Working tree.\n\n\nCopy stashed file to Working tree and do not leave a copy in stash. Commonly used rather than git stash apply\n\n\n\nCopy stashed file to Working tree\n\n\n\nDelete stashed item\n\n\n\nClears out all stashed items\n\n\n\n13: Remotes\n\n\nThe best practice with syncing with a remote branch while minimizing conflicts with other collaborators is to fetch the changes from remote repository first before committing your own changes to the remote repository.\n\n\nYou made changes on your local computer and waiting to push changes to remote repository\n\n\nFetch the new changes from remote repository. If you take a look at the gif below, origin/master is a local copy of the remote repository\n\n\nMerge your awaiting changes to the branch that you just fetched to remote repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have multiple remote repositories per project.\n\n\n\nRemove remote alias\n\n\n\nPush branch to remote repository. The -u switch enables git to keep tracking the files which is what you want usually.\n\n\n\nShow local/remote branches\n\n\n\nUse this command when you forgot to use git push -u to track a branch. This modifies the .git/config file\n\n\n\nNo need to add tracking branch name for this command if you initially used git push -u to track the branch\n\n\n\nThis fetches the latest changes from remote repository and updates the local origin/master copy on your machine. Important reminder is that your origin/master does not reflect the changes of master. Git manages origin/master.\n\n\n\nGuidelines for fetching:\n\n\nFetch before you work\n\n\nFetch before you push\n\n\nFetch often\n\n\n\n\ngit pull = git fetch + git merge - Convenient command but you should remember that git pull is a cominbation of these two commands. This way you know how to troubleshoot what is wrong in the fetch and merge process.\n\n\nCheckout and track non-tracking branch from origin then switch to that branch\n\n\n\nPushing to an updated remote branch:\n\n\nFetch first\n\n\nMerge changes\n\n\nPush changes\n\n\n\n\nDelete branch from remote repository\n\n\n\nCollaboration video example\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/tutorial-git/","title":"Git Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/tutorial-regex/":{"body":"https://www.lynda.com/Regular-Expressions-tutorials\n1\n\nThere are different types of RegEx engines that will behave slightly different than others.\n\n2\n\n\nLiteral characters\n\n\nRegular expressions are eager - important to keep in mind.

The pattern of how to analyze protocols is similar across multiple protocols so if you learn one technique, the variation from the next shouldn't be difficult unless some complicated handshaking is involved like SSL/TLS. This guide should illuminate the common features used and most time spent in Wireshark.\nEssentials: Capture Filters\nCapture Filters are set before starting a packet capture and cannot be modified during the capture. This is where you set the parameters of which you want to capture data from specific or range of targets.\nhttps://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters\n\nCommon examples of what you can do with capture filters:\nCapture only traffic to or from IP address 172.18.5.4:\n\nCapture traffic to or from a range of IP addresses:\n\nor\n\nCapture traffic from a range of IP addresses:\n\nor\n\nCapture traffic to a range of IP addresses:\n\nor\n\nCapture only DNS (port 53) traffic:\n\nCapture non-HTTP and non-SMTP traffic on your server (both are equivalent):\n\nCapture except all ARP and DNS traffic:\n\nCapture traffic within a range of ports\n\nEssentials: Display Filters\nBe aware, this feature is commonly confused with Capture Filter and it's entirely a different feature set. Display Filters are used for general filtering after capturing the network data traffic. \nCommon examples of what you can do with capture filters:\nShow only SMTP (port 25) and ICMP traffic:\n\nShow only traffic in the LAN (192.168.x.x), between workstations and servers -- no Internet:\n\nTCP buffer full -- Source is instructing Destination to stop sending data\n\nFilter on Windows -- Filter out noise, while watching Windows Client - DC exchanges\n\nTo better understand the basics of how you can filter any type of field items you would like, by selecting any items in the Packet Details section, it will show you the filter ID on the bottom of the window. In the filtering text box, if you sort using the filtering ID as desired, you can use comparison operators to find specific values or ranges.\n\nEssentials: Follow the Protocol Stream:\nIt can be very helpful to see a protocol in the way that the application layer sees it. Perhaps you are looking for passwords in a Telnet stream, or you are trying to make sense of a data stream. Maybe you just need a display filter to show only the packets in a TLS or SSL stream. By following a particular stream, you are able to trace and isolate network traffic for the specific protocol.\n\nEssentials: Export Objects\nNetwork traffic can be reconstructed back into readable files without the need for external tools. At times, there are plenty of readable files to sift through and it can be difficult to trace back which protocol stream it belongs to. In order to trace the exported file and the packet stream, take note of the packet number column in the export window. Back to the main window, there is a button to specify which packet you want to view in the packet list.\n\n\nTelnet\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nFTP\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nFTP: PASV\nFollow TCP stream:\n\nFundamental knowledge when analyzing protocols, if you see a data connection to obtain or read files, chances are there is a second stream of which you can view what is being downloaded or read. You can view the second TCP stream inside the same window of which when you use the Follow TCP stream function.\n\nRSH: Reading Client and Server Interactions\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nrLogin: Viewing Credentials in Cleartext\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nSMTP\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nDecode the base64 values to reveal the string:\n\nSMTP: Email Zip Attachments\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nSave the attachment info a file:\n\n\nDecode the data filed using uudecode:\n\nThe data file is ready to unzip:\n\nFYI, the other easier method rather than doing it manual is using Wireshark's Export feature:\n\nPOP\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nIMAP\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nHTTP\nWhat is important about analyzing HTTP protocol is looking at the overall content of the data stream. Look for clues like type of HTTP request, sensitive authorization headers, cookies, parameters, tokens, response body.\nFollow the TCP stream:\n\nAuthorization header example:\n\nDecode the Authorization header by using base64:\n\nJWT header example:\n\nDecode the JWT token using jwt-cli tool:\n\nHTTP: Follow TCP Stream vs HTTP Stream\nThis is what the output would look like when you follow the TCP stream:\n\nAs you can see, the stream is not decoded correctly as this is a display of a ASCII format. In order to read the body of the HTTP packet, you need to\nfollow the stream as HTML instead and it would detect the Content-Encoding type and decode accordingly:\n\nThe more difficult way to do this is follow the TCP stream as usual, convert the content type as RAW instead of ASCII and save the file as .gz\nbecause the Content-Encoding type. Manually extract the .gz file afterwards. As an example, this method can be performed for Content-Encoding: deflated:\n\nKeep in mind, the difference between gzip and deflate is the way it compresses the data. deflate uses zlib which will require a header to\nreconstruct the file:\n\n\nNow we need to insert the zlib header for gzip to recognize the file for extraction:\n\nDNS: Reading DNS Queries\nTo read DNS queries, select the DNS protocol captured, in the Packet Details window, there is a Queries dropdown menu of which will display the DNS\nquery types and the answer provided from the server. Keep in mind, DNS queries can also be sent using TCP so keep an eye out for those data streams when identifying DNS\nprotocols.\nDNS: Predictable Transaction IDs\nThere is an old attack called \"Birthday Attack\" of which forged DNS response queries with predictable transaction ID is sent to the client before the real DNS\nresponse is received. To analyze the DNS transaction ID, select the DNS packet and view the Packet Details window, select the Domain Name System (query) dropdown to view the Transaction ID field. If the ID starts with 0x0000, there might be a chance that the next packet sent is\npredictable. View the pattern from the rest of the DNS data stream to try and identify a sequential pattern by converting the hexadecimal to decimal. Be aware, this attack doesn't commonly\nfound with the exception of IoT and legacy devices.\n\nICMP: Finding covert data\nICMP protocols can be used as a covert channel to send information from one system to another without raising alarms.\n\nTLS 1.2: Identifying Certificate Names\nClient TLS connections perform a handshake with a server endpoint. Identifying the certificate used in the handshake process can reveal information about the server being established by the client. This is good for tracing encrypted communication and perform additional reconnaissance.\n\nTLS 1.2: Server Name Indication (SNI)\nLike a HTTP server, using HTTP headers can indicate where responses are being sent and the responses received. When TLS is applied to the HTTP request, the HTTP headers do not get initiated until the TLS connection is established first. This is where exploration of TLS extension called Server Name Indiciation (SNI) is important to learn about.\nA single IP may host multiple TLS server on the same port and the server needs to identify what certificate it needs to send to the client. If the server sends the wrong certificate to the client, it will be rejected by the client. The way to indicate the certificate that belongs to which server is using SNI. The client will send a TLS handshake request to the server and the server will serve the certificate being requested. By looking at the TLS packet, you can find where the TLS traffic is being requested by the client.\n\nTLS 1.2: Decrypting using Private Key\nWireshark has the ability to decrypt TLS connections if provided a private key to read the communication. However, this only applies if the connection does not use Forward Secrecy. Forward Secrecy is used to prevent mishaps such as leaked private keys or broken cryptography from being used to decrypt the traffic prior to the compromise to cleartext.\n\n\n\nTLS 1.2: Forward Secrecy and Pre-master Key\nIf the captured TLS traffic is using Forward Secrecy, you cannot decrypt the connection with the server's private key. This ensures that if the server's private key is compromised, someone sniffing the traffic prior to the compromise cannot recover the cleartext traffic. However, by modifying the client or the server, it's possible to retrieve the pre-shared key used to secure the communication using premaster key. The premaster key is essentially the two random numbers used in the encryption process between client and server. If you have the premaster key along with the server's private key, you can decrypt the TLS stream using forward secrecy.\nAdd the private key to the TLS key settings:\n\n\nConfigure the debug output in order to view the decrypted results. This step will allow you to debug the TLS sessions in play and you can follow play by play with how the TLS session is doing:\n\n\nConfigure the premaster key:\n\nThe premaster key file contains the following:\n\n\nThe TLS stream should be now decrypted and you can follow the TLS stream to view the decrypted traffic. Lastly, pay attention to the bottom where an arrow is marked.\n\nMySQL: Login and Password\nMySQL request and responses can be read in plaintext only if encryption is not used.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/tutorial-wireshark/","title":"Wireshark Tutorial"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/vulnhub-btrsys21/":{"body":"Prior to studying OSCP{:.info}\n\n\nUsed zenmap GUI to scan 192.168.225.0/24 range.\n\nIntense TCP all ports:\n\nIntense UDP all ports:\n\nSlow comprehensive scan:\n\n\n\nStarted enumeration process:\n\n\n\n\nRabbit hole - VSftpd 3.0.3 is being hosted on port 21.
