# My Job Thingy ü§ì

I'm a seasoned IT professional with a passion for Cybersecurity. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of serving both public and private sectors across North America, earning a reputation as a trusted advisor and go-to expert in my field.

My unique blend of technical expertise and foundational knowledge of governance, risk, and compliance has enabled me to accelerate my own career path through my unwavering commitment to staying ahead of the curve. As someone who believes that information security requires a holistic approach, I understand that protecting against cyber attacks involves more than just technology - it also involves people and processes.

Throughout my professional journey, I've consistently demonstrated a collaborative spirit, earning recognition as a cheerful and reliable expert who is always willing to lend my expertise to others. With a strong sense of agency and a deep commitment to helping others achieve their goals, I take pride in being able to make a positive impact on those around me and enjoying the relationships I've built along the way.

I'm not just a pale skinned basement dweller, folks! When I'm not glued to my screens, I'm a hot mess of hobbies and interests. Have dogs? I'm a [dog watcher](./gaze/doggos) of a few fluffers - woof! Love coffee? Let's [geek out](./gaze/experiment-hardness/) over espresso and caffeine addiction! Into hardcore endurance sports? I'm scared but [sign me up](./gaze/running/) for the next event... or at least the couch-to-fridge sprint (let's be real, that's my PR on Strava). And don't even get me started on taming the noisy brain - we can [meditate](./posts/personal-10dayspt1/), manifest, and maybe even conjure up some inner peace (just kidding, I'll probably just zone out thinking about coffee again).Ô∏è
