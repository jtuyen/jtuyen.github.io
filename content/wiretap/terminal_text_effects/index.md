> [TerminalTextEffects](https://chrisbuilds.github.io/terminaltexteffects/) (TTE) is a terminal visual effects engine. TTE can be installed as a system application to produce effects in your terminal, or as a Python library to enable effects within your Python scripts/applications.

God damn.. this is awesome! You can pipe any CLI command into `tte` and it will produce a text effect. I do have a presentation coming up for a larger audience, I could use this for the "lulz" effect.
