[How to Quit Google, According to a Privacy Expert](https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-quit-google-according-to-a-privacy-expert)

> Don't switch everything at once.

There are two things I wanted to get rid of for a long time, Gmail and Photos. Gmail will be tackled in a later post. I've been meaning to DeGoogle from Photos but haven't found a good solution when I last checked years ago. As I'm nearing max storage limits once again, I took another glance at this problem. To my surprise, there are plenty of [FOSS projects](https://meichthys.github.io/foss_photo_libraries/) to choose from. What caught my interest was this self-hosted project called [Immich](https://immich.app/). It has everything I needed including backup features and web/IOS application. The only problem I'm forseeing is getting the URL endpoint to be publicly accessible so I can sync photos while I'm away from home base. It would be foolish to open a public endpoint to my home IP and there is no reason to do so. Modern solutions like Cloudflare zero trust can provide additional layer of protection for sensitive services. For now, I'll try this out as it meets most of my requirements and passes my sniff test.
