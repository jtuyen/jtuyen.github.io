Wow, how did I not know about this earlier? This saves a lot of time looking into attack paths to mimic and remix as my own.

Comparing to my custom threat intelligence reports that I receive on a daily basis, this is better for actionable items rather than high level summary of active APTs. Which is fine because not everyone needs to know the technical details of what the attack paths, opsec, and targets look like. For those aspiring red teamers, you will need to understand how the threat actors operate in order to mimic the TTPs and measure the risk results based on the organization security controls. The fun part from all of this is remixing with your own style based on your strengths. You be surprised how fast you can learn, pivot, and discover along the way. You end up having a stockpile of hacky scripts that can be reused or remixed again.
