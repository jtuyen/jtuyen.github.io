Going to be a busy couple of days as I'm taking the SpecterOps Adversary Tactics Red Team Operations course. Operational security and situational awareness was the theme today. So far I'm impressed with the breadth and depth of the material. It's not so much about the learning material but the trainers sharing valuable lessons learned in the field. One that stuck with me was this:

> Always operate with purpose, sometimes you don't need to privesc unless you have a goal in mind.

That's something you would say when you know Windows Internals inside and out. 

If it's one thing about this course, there isn't too much time in between labs and letting the course material sink in. However, I think it is intentional as there is a lot of good stuff to cover. I'm not complaining, just have to buckle up and enjoy the ride.
