Hey look, Windows built-in a keylogger without the need of installing one because of "AI productivity". The fact that they do not perform content moderation on captured data containing passwords and sensitive information will be a treasure trove for hackers and potentially abusive friends/family to reveal what you read/viewed/accessed. Even though it has the ability to filter out certain applications from being "Recalled," how many users out there actually know how?

The user experience is similar when using BitLocker. How many users thought that the first thing during initial setup was to enable BitLocker? From what I've commonly seen in the past, most people will skip that part for later because saving/storing a recovery key may be seen as a nuisance and less likely to be revisited to complete the steps. Users wouldn't even know that they need it as the computer is working as intended to get their job done.
