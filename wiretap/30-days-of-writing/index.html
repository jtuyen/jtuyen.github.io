  <article><p>You might wonder, what the heck is the point of this post? Am I thinking of starting to write a book or something? Nah, not inspired enough to do so. Rather, I've challeged myself to publish a post every single day regardless of the quality and type of content. What I wanted to experiment is the idea of creating a weekly newsletter that contains ideas, discoveries, and stories around mostly technology and information security space. During this experiment I discovered a few things about myself, content creation, and what it will take to succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastering the art of journalistic writing in a quick manner is a skill. For me, if it's a topic that is difficult to quickly consume, it's hard to extract a clear concept that is concise and to the point especially when you have to ship the post by end of day as part of the challenge.</li>
<li>Learning to analyze articles while reading from a micro and macro point of view. Jotting down notes as I read along as the micro. When finishing the article, read the completed notes as a macro view and create a clear concept. Easier said than done (for me atleast).</li>
<li>Experimenting writing using my own voice and style is a powerful daily exercise if the purpose is to connect and communicate. It allows you to take risks and refine stories that you want to share without worrying the outcome.</li>
<li>Finding content is easy but curating content with purpose is harder. You would think that with all the news and social feeds, you would have unlimited content to choose from but it's not the case I soon realized. Actively cutting through the noise is a messy chore and it's not easy to find content that would deem worthy. For every 10 articles read, I would maybe find one decent article or social feed that I think is worth sharing. To solve this problem, I would write a web scraper to feed into an LLM with a prompt that would extrapolate the article according to my standards I'm looking for. Although, I don't want to mechanize this process that seems unnatural. I still want to personally read and make my own opinions on it. This will be my next experiment that I'll be tinkering with and I will be posting less going forward until I refine this process so it's not as time consuming.</li>
